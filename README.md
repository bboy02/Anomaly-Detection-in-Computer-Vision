# Anomaly-Detection-in-Computer-Vision
Implementation of SOTA anomaly detection models (Patchcore &amp; EfficientAD)
This repository contains three distinct folders, each dedicated to an anomaly detection pipeline:

1. PatchCore (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08265)
2. PatchCore+ViT
3. EfficientAD (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14535)

Each folder includes:

- The main pipeline code for anomaly detection.
- Supporting files required for the pipeline.
- A comprehensive README file with detailed instructions for running the pipeline in a CLI environment.
